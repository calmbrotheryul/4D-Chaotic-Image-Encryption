This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the chaotic image encryption algorithm proposed in our manuscript submitted to *The Visual Computer*. The algorithm integrates chaotic systems with multiple diffusion and permutation stages to achieve high security and performance. Comprehensive experimental evaluations, including statistical, security, and robustness analyses, are included.

## üîç Overview
This project presents a MATLAB implementation of a novel grayscale image encryption algorithm based on a four-dimensional (4D) continuous chaotic system with strong dissipative properties. The method addresses the limitations of conventional encryption schemes when applied to image data, such as large size and strong inter-pixel correlation.

Key components of the algorithm include:

Image-dependent key generation using SHA-256 to derive initial conditions from the input image

Global Arnold scrambling and intra-block dynamic Zigzag scanning to increase positional randomness

Dual diffusion process combining chaotic orbits, XOR operations, and inter-block chaining for high sensitivity and security

Robust performance evaluation, including metrics such as entropy, NPCR, UACI, and key sensitivity

Simulations on standard test images demonstrate that the algorithm achieves strong security performance, with an average NPCR of 99.61% and UACI of 33.46%, surpassing several state-of-the-art methods.

This code is directly related to our manuscript submitted to The Visual Computer, and is intended to facilitate reproducibility and future research in chaos-based image encryption.
